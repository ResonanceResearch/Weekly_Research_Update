Such “universal vaccines” are an idealized, but unrealized, goal that may benefit from unbiased, high-throughput approaches that define antibody cross-reactivity to enable rational selection of cross-protective epitopes. The priority of this investigation is to establish a pipeline for the identification and preliminary characterization of epitopes with enhanced cross-reactivity. A peptide immunoarray representing the proteomes of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-II, and MERS-CoV was applied to characterize spike glycoprotein-specific antibody populations within convalescence serum of SARS-CoV-II infected ferrets. Through two alternate bioinformatic approaches, twenty candidate epitopes were identified and translated into vaccines. Epitopes inducing antibodies with cross-reactivity across naturally occurring versions of spike glycoprotein, including SARS-CoV-II Delta and Omicron variants, as well as antigenically distant SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, were identified. Working from the assumption that cross-reactivity is prerequisite for cross-protection, this highlights the opportunity and mechanisms by which immunoarrays, coupled with in vitro screening assays, can enable rational selection of epitopes with enhanced potential for cross-protection.",

This study investigated host autoreactivities in SARS-CoV-2 infections, their association with severe COVID-19, and the neutralizing antibody response. Circulating autoantibodies were detected in convalescent serum samples from unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Clustering, correlation analysis, principal component analysis, and neural network modeling were used to explore the relationship between autoantibodies, hospitalization, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. The presence of one autoantibody correlated with the detection of multiple others. Anti-IFNα antibodies were associated with elevated levels of anti-ENAs (extractable-nuclear antigen) but not with clinical outcome. COVID-19 hospitalization was significantly associated with the collective expression of autoantibodies targeting three ENAs: SSA/Ro52, Jo-1, and RNP. In contrast, autoantibodies targeting RNP/Sm, PCNA, Scl-70, and PL-12 were strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. In summary, this study has identified self-antigens targeted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and highlights a novel association between the autoantibody response and the antiviral humoral response.",
