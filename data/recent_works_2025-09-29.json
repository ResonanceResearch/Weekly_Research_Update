Despite their emerging public health threat, data on Arctic mosquito populations and CSG virus prevalence remain limited. To address this gap, we conducted a 3-yr mosquito surveillance program at 8 sites across northern Canada and the United States, engaging local community members in mosquito collection through a standardized protocol using a butterfly net. From 4,038 sampled mosquitoes, we identified 18 species—17 of which were from the genus Aedes Meigen, 1818. We also reported new distribution records for Aedes euedes Howard, Dyar, &amp; Knab, 1913, Aedes implicatus Vockeroth, 1954, and Aedes spencerii (Theobald, 1901). JCV was detected in 10 mosquito species across 7 sites, while SSHV was detected in just one species at a single site. Notably, JCV was found in Ae. euedes, Aedes impiger (Walker, 1948), and Aedes pionips Dyar, 1919 for the first time in North America. JCV was detected in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, where only 3 Arctic mosquito species were present, none of which are recognized as potential JCV vectors. This finding raises the possibility of undocumented vector species or a previously unrecognized transmission role for Arctic mosquitoes. The broad distribution of JCV across species and locations suggests widespread enzootic transmission, underscoring the need to reassess the potential of Arctic mosquitoes as disease vectors in a rapidly changing climate.",

      "abstract_text": "Abstract Wildlife health and conservation are increasingly recognized as key to improving human, animal, and environmental health (One Health) and detecting and addressing threats such as altered distribution and transmission of zoonotic diseases due to climate change. Wildlife, and therefore wildlife management, are crucial for the livelihood and well‐being of people in the Canadian North, a vast geographic area with low population density and socio‐economic disparities, which can make widespread program implementation challenging. We analyzed and compared 4 case studies on collaborative programs on wildlife health management from 4 distinct jurisdictions in the Canadian North: the Yukon, chronic wasting disease surveillance in ungulates; Northwest Territories, rabies in arctic fox ( Vulpes lagopus ); Nunavut, foodborne diseases in harvested wildlife; and Nunavik, Québec, ringed seal ( Pusa hispida ) health and Trichinella in walrus ( Odobenus rosmarus ). The case studies differed in whether they focused on a specific pathogen, transmission route, or health of a specific wildlife population. Despite these differences, 3 main themes were common to all case studies: collaboration, infrastructure limitations, and adaptation. Collaboration promotes greater community buy‐in and investment as community members help shape the program and is key to long‐term success, sustainability, and local relevance. Laboratory infrastructure and human resource capacity are limited in most regions, highlighting the importance of collaboration among Indigenous‐managed boards and organizations, community members, government agencies at multiple levels, academic institutions, and the national wildlife health non‐governmental organization (Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative). Examples of adaptations include capitalizing on wildlife harvest for fur and food to obtain samples for surveillance, developing regulations to train and permit veterinary paraprofessionals and community volunteers to facilitate co‐existence of pets and people with wildlife reservoirs of rabies, jointly developing regulations to prevent introduction of non‐endemic diseases, and adapting hunting locations based on the results of wildlife disease monitoring. Combining Indigenous knowledge and a One Health framework is fundamental to co‐managing zoonotic and food‐borne diseases in wildlife while respecting Indigenous ways of life. The case studies provide meaningful examples of collaboration and solutions to address complex problems at the One Health interface and to use a holistic and community‐based approach to facilitate the creation of regionally acceptable and culturally relevant programs, with better outcomes for wildlife, human, and environmental health.",
      "abstract_snippet_250w": "Abstract Wildlife health and conservation are increasingly recognized as key to improving human, animal, and environmental health (One Health) and detecting and addressing threats such as altered distribution and transmission of zoonotic diseases due to climate change. Wildlife, and therefore wildlife management, are crucial for the livelihood and well‐being of people in the Canadian North, a vast geographic area with low population density and socio‐economic disparities, which can make widespread program implementation challenging. We analyzed and compared 4 case studies on collaborative programs on wildlife health management from 4 distinct jurisdictions in the Canadian North: the Yukon, chronic wasting disease surveillance in ungulates; Northwest Territories, rabies in arctic fox ( Vulpes lagopus ); Nunavut, foodborne diseases in harvested wildlife; and Nunavik, Québec, ringed seal ( Pusa hispida ) health and Trichinella in walrus ( Odobenus rosmarus ). The case studies differed in whether they focused on a specific pathogen, transmission route, or health of a specific wildlife population. Despite these differences, 3 main themes were common to all case studies: collaboration, infrastructure limitations, and adaptation. Collaboration promotes greater community buy‐in and investment as community members help shape the program and is key to long‐term success, sustainability, and local relevance. Laboratory infrastructure and human resource capacity are limited in most regions, highlighting the importance of collaboration among Indigenous‐managed boards and organizations, community members, government agencies at multiple levels, academic institutions, and the national wildlife health non‐governmental organization (Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative).

      "abstract_text": "Structure-guided optimization was applied to develop a potent and selective inhibitor of the aminotransferase BioA, a key enzyme in bacterial biotin biosynthesis. Strategic modifications of a screening hit enhanced potency and pharmacokinetics, yielding C48, which binds BioA with a Ki of 200 pM and displays sub-micromolar MICs against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and nontuberculous mycobacteria. Biochemical, structural, and genetic studies confirmed C48's mechanism of action. In vitro, C48 induced cell envelope stress and membrane remodeling, mimicking biotin starvation. Pharmacokinetic profiling revealed excellent oral bioavailability resulting in over 39,000-fold improved exposure versus the parent compound. To address the discrepancy in biotin levels between humans and mice, we developed a low-biotin mouse model that recapitulates human biotin physiology. In this model C48 reduced Mtb burden in lungs and spleen, providing the first in vivo proof-of-concept for targeting biotin biosynthesis as a therapeutic strategy against tuberculosis.",
