In this study, the fast-growing, non-pathogenic model mycobacteria Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2-155 was engineered to express the M. tb T7SS ESX-1 system. We found that M. smegmatis transformed with M. tb esx-1 locus genes only, as well as M. smegmatis transformed with M. tb esx-1 and espACD operon genes (designated MSX-1), produces and secretes the M. tb ESX-1 protein effectors EsxA, EsxB, and EspB. However, the abundance of these proteins was higher inside the cell and culture filtrate of the MSX-1 strain. Although ESX-1 is critical for M. tb pathogenesis, expression of M. tb ESX-1 did not make the recombinant M. smegmatis strains virulent in macrophages. Serendipitously, transformation of M. smegmatis with a modified esx-1 locus in this study revealed rv3860, a gene of previously unknown function, to be required for the transcription of pe35, ppe68, esxB, and esxA genes. Finally, mice vaccinated with MSX-1 were found to be as protected as mice vaccinated with Mycobacterium bovis BCG against M. tb infection, without becoming sensitized to tuberculin. These results show that a functional M. tb ESX-1 system can be assembled in M. smegmatis to uncover novel facets of the secretion machinery and that the modified M. smegmatis strain can function as a tuberculosis (TB) vaccine. Unlike BCG, however, its deployment may be compatible with tests currently used to diagnose TB.IMPORTANCEIn this study, we modified Mycobacterium smegmatis, which is often used as a surrogate model organism in mycobacterial research, to produce and assemble a functional Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) ESX-1 protein secretion system. One such M. smegmatis strain named MSX-1 was found to make a functional M. tb ESX-1 system without becoming virulent. And in using M. smegmatis as a chassis to study the ESX-1 system, we found that rv3860, an M. tb gene of previously unknown function, is needed for the production of key ESX-1 proteins. Finally, mice vaccinated with MSX-1 were as protected from tuberculosis (TB) as mice given BCG, the only approved TB vaccine. Notably, we found that unlike BCG, MSX-1 does not sensitize mice to the antigens used in existing TB diagnostic tests. These observations, taken together, highlight the utility of M. smegmatis as a chassis to study the M. tb ESX-1 secretion machinery.",

Infection prevention and targeted treatments would benefit from detecting and identifying bacterial pathogens and, ideally, assessing antibiotic sensitivity. Here, we report success refining targeted metagenomics by hybridization capture sequencing (CapSeq) to detect and genotype bacterial pathogens and genes for antibiotic resistance in BRD. We developed a novel multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) strategy to both enhance assay sensitivity and provide epidemiological data compatible with traditional typing assays. Phylogenetically informed panel design by ProbeTools coupled with hybridization capture enabled the sequencing of novel genotypes and elucidated coinfection by distinct strains of Mycoplasmopsis bovis. CapSeq was orders of magnitude more sensitive than classical metagenomics at a scale compatible with low-throughput DNA sequencing capacity in diagnostic laboratories. Iterative design and testing of longer typing loci confirmed improvements in locus detection through a strategy applicable to future target selection. CapSeq detected bacterial pathogens that evaded detection by traditional metagenomics, and it demonstrated greater range and sensitivity for antibiotic resistance gene detection. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing for infectious disease diagnostics and surveillance benefits from simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens in a sample. Adding a hybridization probe capture step to the metagenomics workflow enriches targeted loci to improve the sensitivity of pathogen detection without compromising the ability to detect pathogen variants. Our custom probe panel enables multi-locus sequence typing of bovine respiratory disease agents as well as capture of antibiotic resistance genes, which improves the sensitivity of metagenomic testing and provides genotyping data compatible with traditional assays. This study demonstrates the utility of new design principles for probe panels; it also demonstrates how targeted metagenomics provides important new insights into co-infections and is equally useful for surveillance of environmental reservoirs of disease agents.",
