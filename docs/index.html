      <div style="white-space:pre-wrap;line-height:1.4">Peptide immunoarrays for rationale development of vaccines with enhanced cross-reactivity — PLoS ONE (2025-09-04) — Cohort author: Antonio Facciuolo.
Notable findings: Twenty candidate epitopes were identified using a peptide immunoarray spanning SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV; epitopes induced antibodies with cross-reactivity across Delta/Omicron and other coronaviruses; a two-pronged bioinformatic approach and in vitro screening were used to establish a pipeline for selecting cross-protective epitopes.

Distinct circulating autoantibodies are associated with COVID-19 hospitalization and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity — npj Viruses (2025-09-02) — Cohort author: Arinjay Banerjee.
Notable findings: Convalescent sera reveal autoantibody signatures linked to hospitalization and to neutralizing activity; anti-IFN-α autoantibodies correlate with elevated ENA levels but not with clinical outcome; hospitalization is associated with collective autoantibody expression against ENAs SSA/Ro52, Jo-1, and RNP.

          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">Vaccines of enhanced range of protection could help to control newly emerging infectious diseases while providing greater resilience to any subsequent variants. Such “universal vaccines” are an idealized, but unrealized, goal that may benefit from unbiased, high-throughput approaches that define antibody cross-reactivity to enable rational selection of cross-protective epitopes. The priority of this investigation is to establish a pipeline for the identification and preliminary characterization of epitopes with enhanced cross-reactivity. A peptide immunoarray representing the proteomes of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-II, and MERS-CoV was applied to characterize spike glycoprotein-specific antibody populations within convalescence serum of SARS-CoV-II infected ferrets. Through two alternate bioinformatic approaches, twenty candidate epitopes were identified and translated into vaccines. Epitopes inducing antibodies with cross-reactivity across naturally occurring versions of spike glycoprotein, including SARS-CoV-II Delta and Omicron variants, as well as antigenically distant SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, were identified. Working from the assumption that cross-reactivity is prerequisite for cross-protection, this highlights the opportunity and mechanisms by which immunoarrays, coupled with in vitro screening assays, can enable rational selection of epitopes with enhanced potential for cross-protection.</div></details></td>

          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">SARS-CoV-2 infection disrupts the host&#x27;s immune system, altering autoimmune responses. This study investigated host autoreactivities in SARS-CoV-2 infections, their association with severe COVID-19, and the neutralizing antibody response. Circulating autoantibodies were detected in convalescent serum samples from unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Clustering, correlation analysis, principal component analysis, and neural network modeling were used to explore the relationship between autoantibodies, hospitalization, and SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. The presence of one autoantibody correlated with the detection of multiple others. Anti-IFNα antibodies were associated with elevated levels of anti-ENAs (extractable-nuclear antigen) but not with clinical outcome. COVID-19 hospitalization was significantly associated with the collective expression of autoantibodies targeting three ENAs: SSA/Ro52, Jo-1, and RNP. In contrast, autoantibodies targeting RNP/Sm, PCNA, Scl-70, and PL-12 were strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. In summary, this study has identified self-antigens targeted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and highlights a novel association between the autoantibody response and the antiviral humoral response.</div></details></td>
