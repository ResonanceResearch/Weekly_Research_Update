- CpG/UpA enrichment in the E region yields the E-MAX variant that is immunogenic, protects mice from lethal infection, and causes no mortality, with brain infection occasionally detected.
- Attenuation is ZAP-dependent; dinucleotide-enriched variants show limited reversion and use ZAP-WT/KO systems to validate stability, with the E-MAX+ FR variant eliminating neuroinvasion while preserving immunogenicity.
- Upregulation of interferon signaling genes in human cells suggests a mechanism by which CpG/UpA enrichment enhances immunogenicity, supporting a CpG/UpA-based vaccine platform.

Design-of-experiments based development and in vitro evaluation of a cationic lipid-based triple adjuvanted subunit pertussis vaccine — European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics — 2025-10-01 — Cohort author: Volker Gerdts.

- DoE-guided optimization advances a cationic lipid-based triple adjuvanted subunit pertussis vaccine candidate.
- In vitro evaluation assesses formulation performance and immunogenicity-relevant readouts.
- The work, led by Volker Gerdts, demonstrates a DoE-driven approach to vaccine formulation and testing.

          <td data-label="Abstract"><details><summary>view</summary><div style="white-space:pre-wrap">West Nile virus (WNV) poses a global public health threat. This study demonstrates that the WNV RNA tolerates CpG and UpA dinucleotide enrichment in different genomic regions resulting in attenuation of CpG- and CpG/UpA-enriched variants. Attenuation was zinc finger antiviral protein 1 (ZAP)-dependent, and ZAP knockout (ZAP-KO) cells were used to generate high-titer stocks. Ten enriched variants, with permuted control and wild-type (WT) viruses, were screened in immunocompetent mice upon intraperitoneal injection. In contrast to lethal WNV-WT and permuted viruses, the E-MAX variant, with the RNA region encoding envelope (E) protein enriched both with CpG and UpA, caused no mortality. E-MAX was immunogenic and protective against lethal challenge. Stability of enriched dinucleotides was confirmed upon serial passaging in ZAP-WT and ZAP-KO cells, with only minor (17–21%) reversion at a single site in ZAP-WT condition. E-MAX upregulated interferon (IFN) signaling genes in human cells, suggesting that the combination of CpG/UpA-mediated attenuation, and concurrent activation of IFN responses potentially driven by CpG/UpA enrichment, may contribute to E-MAX immunogenicity. Evaluation using footpad injection in mice showed E-MAX had a promising safety and immunogenicity profile, although brain infection was occasionally detected. Then, we developed the E-MAX+ FR variant by combining CpG/UpA enrichment with two amino acid substitutions in functional domains of the E protein. This strategy eliminated neuroinvasion while maintaining immunogenicity and protection. Altogether, CpG/UpA dinucleotide enrichment in the genomic E region in combination with amino acid substitutions in the E protein yields a promising platform for vaccine development against WNV and potentially other flaviviruses.</div></details></td>
